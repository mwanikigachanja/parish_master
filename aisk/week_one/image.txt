Produce a detailed technical illustration of a spacecraft, showcasing a cutaway design that reveals its internal structure. The spacecraft should be rendered with a sleek, streamlined body in vibrant orange and metallic shades. The image must include annotated engineering blueprints, detailed schematics, and callouts, set against a technical background that provides a comprehensive view of the craft's design. Aim for a sketch-like style that merges artistic intricacy with mechanical precision, complete with various angles and detailed exploded views of spacecraft components
