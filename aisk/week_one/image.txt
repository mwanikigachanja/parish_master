Produce a detailed technical illustration of a spacecraft, showcasing a cutaway design that reveals its internal structure. The spacecraft should be rendered with a sleek, streamlined body in vibrant orange and metallic shades. The image must include annotated engineering blueprints, detailed schematics, and callouts, set against a technical background that provides a comprehensive view of the craft's design. Aim for a sketch-like style that merges artistic intricacy with mechanical precision, complete with various angles and detailed exploded views of spacecraft components

AI image prompt
An AI image prompt is essentially the text input you provide to an AI system to generate an image. By carefully structuring your prompts and providing the right kinds of words, you can significantly improve the quality of the images you generate. Imagine giving an artist specific instructions for a painting; the more detailed and vivid your instructions, the more likely the final piece will align with your vision. The same logic applies to AI image prompts. Crafting effective prompts is a skill, one you can master with practice.
